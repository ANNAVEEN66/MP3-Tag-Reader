# MP3-Tag-Reader
An MP3 Tag Reader is a tool used to read metadata embedded inside MP3 audio files. MP3 files often contain ID3 tags, which store information about the track such as title, artist, album, genre, year, and more. This project allows users to extract and display those details in a simple and structured format.
